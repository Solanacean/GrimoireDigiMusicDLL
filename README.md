## GrimoireDigiMusicDLL
GrimoireDigiMusicDLL is a wrapper which adds support for digital music (MP3) to Grimoire: Heralds of the Winged Exemplar. 
It is compatible with both Grimoire V1 and V2. 

### Building from source code
To build the wrapper from source code you need Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017. The following libraries are another requirement:

[Microsoft Detours Express 3.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52586)  
[BASS audio library 2.4](http://www.un4seen.com/bass.html)

Building the project will produce file `dsound.dll` (which is not to be confused with dsound.dll residing in your Windows system folder).
    
### Installation
Copy `dsound.dll` and `bass.dll` to the game's installation folder. The wrapper will look for the tracks in MP3 format
in a subfolder named `Music` which must contain all the required files (see details below).

The game's folder should look like this (note the `Music` folder and its content and the files `bass.dll` and `dsound.dll`):<br>

Each time the game is launched (provided you installed the wrapper correctly) a `DIGIMUSIC_LOG.txt` file will be created 
in the gameâ€™s folder. In case something goes wrong please check this file for possible error messages.

### Uninstallation
If you'd rather disable the wrapper instead of removing it, go to the game's folder and simply rename `dsound.dll` to e.g. `_dsound.dll` 

To uninstall it, just delete the wrapper's `dsound.dll` from the game's folder. You can also delete the files `bass.dll` and 
`DIGIMUSIC_LOG.txt` as well as the `Music` folder.
